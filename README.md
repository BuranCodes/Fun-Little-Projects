# Fun little projects
 Fun little projects I did!
- Deleting a string's character step by step until empty and then adding back characters until normal again (concatenation basically).
- Basic string censor with regex
- Packaging problem (queue problem)
- Learning how to use pointers to access struct members and change variables

Other noteworthy things in the repository:
- Red Flood, a python game I made back then in 2021 when I didn't have much coding experience
