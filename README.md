# Fun little projects
 A collection of the fun little projects anyone can post here!
 ## C++:
- Deleting a string's character step by step until empty and then adding back characters until normal again (concatenation basically).
- Basic string censor with regex
- Packaging problem (queue problem)
- Learning how to use pointers to access struct members and change variables
## Python
- Red Flood, a python game I made back then in 2021 when I didn't have much coding experience
