### How to run:
Disclaimer: I might or might not have covered everything ^^'

C++: Make sure you have latest C++ compiler installed. To run executables in Windows terminal: `.\[c++ executable]`. For Linux terminals: `./[c++ executable]`.
C: Same as above, but with C or C/C++ compiler.


Python: Make sure you have latest Python installed. To run Python scripts in your terminal, do `python [pythonfile]`.
